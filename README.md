# Certificate-Generator

- You can make a post request alongside and can send the certificate in jpg, jpeg, png, webp format. The image will be stored in client-side, 
- then there is another route where you can send an xlsx file with names written on it. Rather than storing it anywhere, it will give you a zip file in the response containing all the pdf files with their name written on a specific coordinate.
- Below are the videos of the same.

- need to find more ways of optimizing.
